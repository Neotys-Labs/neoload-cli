Found during usage:

* additional options (like login --url) must precede arguments (such as zone?)
* why are we emitting JSON to the console?
* if in interactive mode, launch browser to logs URL
* when run, Status: INIT just sits there, should be ...s based on polling API
* to change number of LGs, which is it? PUT or PATCH?
* and why are we exposing REST/methods to CLI commands?!
* lack of validation of --as-code files leads to 30mins asking "why failed to start test" (without controller logs)
* would be good to recapitulate estimated test length/iterations before test runs instead of each line
* each running line could have percent complete (based on length or iteration)
* what if we lace the test running status lines with controller & lg CPU/mem metrics?
* need more whitespace between running line column (jagged after 5min test results)
* why do we emit JSON in the post-run test results?
* when exiting during init using CTRL+C, "Test is not running", but then exits the Python process
* change 'neoload status' output from 'settings id' to 'test id'
* shouldn't "test-settings" command really be "tests"?
* logs should be colored, and figlet added back in but only to top-level help and login
* test-settings --scenario ... patch should not overwrite existing lgs and controller config
* travis tokens? https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment-v2/providers/pypi/

Docker:

neoload docker ls   # lists local docker containers related to current test-settings
neoload docker ls [-a|--all]   # lists all local docker containers connected to NeoLoad Web
neoload docker --version [default:latest] --ctrlimage [repo] --lgimage [repo] attach  # uses test-settings \
  to spin up controllers and LGs in static zones; \
  also preserves additional options in local config so that next run, if not running, will re-spin these containers
neoload docker detach   # stops running local containers that were spun as part of the last test
neoload docker detach [-a|--all]   # stops all running local containers that are connected to NeoLoad Web
neoload docker cleanup [-a|--all]   # stops all running local containers and networks spun by this CLI
neoload docker forget   # clears local config of prior docker attach details

neoload run  # should re-spin containers if local config has prior attach details stored, preserve that re-spin was necessary
neoload stop  # if re-spin was necessary, confirm if we should detatch too
neoload test-settings use ...  # if switching and docker currently attached, ask if want to detatch
neoload logout  # always 'neoload docker detatch --all'
