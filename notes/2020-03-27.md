**2020-03-27 CLI project handoff**

1. align on refactoring work
2. discuss testing strategy
3. discuss pipeline/release model
4. 10 points from dev team & team sync

***1. align on refactoring work***

JIRA project for NeoLoad-CLI
Will use Slack and Hangouts as preferred

Code:
Using click, commands and subcommands
Too long/waste to refactor w/out command format
Option names, short version wherever possible (to maintain terseness)
Should options be action-oriented mostly or entity (API) oriented?
 - prefer mixed approach

***2. discuss testing strategy***

existing tests are integration-focused
already built a framework for "just" and "slow"; see conftest.py
all tests should be run before release in a testing pipeline
should we use SaaS or on-prem NLW? on-prem for local, SaaS before release
some features may not yet be available in SaaS (yet)

***3. discuss pipeline/release model***
Reviewed Jenkinsfile
Secrets always outside codebase; all is transparent
Multi-branch once we remove 'develop' in favor of 'master'

***4. 10 points from dev team & team sync***
daily checkins while heavy refactoring timeframe
async anytime; Pat will create Slack channel
