# NeoLoad CLI [![Build Status](https://github.com/Neotys-Labs/neoload-cli/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Neotys-Labs/neoload-cli/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Python+package%22+branch%3A%22master%22)

## Overview

This command-line interface helps you launch and observe performance tests on the Neotys Web Platform. Since NeoLoad is very flexible to many deployment models (SaaS, self-hosted, cloud or local containers, etc.), configuration and test execution parameters depend on your licensing and infrastructure provisioning options.

## Prerequisites
The CLI requires **Python3**
 - Download and install python3 for **Windows 10** from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - Make sure you check the option 'Add Python to the environment variables' option
    - Install pip: ```python -m pip install -U pip```
 - Download and install python3 for **Mac OS X** from [Python.org - Python3 on Mac OS X](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/)

Optional: Install Docker for hosting the test infra on your machine (this feature does not work with Docker for Windows).

## Installation
```
pip3 install neoload
neoload --help
```

NOTE: if you receive SSL download errors when running the above command, you may also need to install sources using the following command:
```
pip3 install certifi
```

## Login to Neoload Web
NeoLoad CLI defaults to using the NeoLoad Web APIs for most operations. That's why you need to login.
```
neoload login [TOKEN]
neoload login --url http://your-onpremise-neoload-api.com/ --workspace "Default Workspace" your-token
```
The CLI will connect by default to Neoload Web SaaS to lease license. \
For self-hosted enterprise license, you must specify the Neoload Web **Api url** with --url. \
\
The CLI stores data locally like api url, token, the workspace ID and the test ID you are working on. **The commands can be chained !**
```
neoload status          # Displays stored data
```

## Setup a test
### Optionally Choose a workspace to work with
```
Usage: neoload workspaces [OPTIONS] [[ls|use]] [NAME_OR_ID]
neoload workspaces use "Default Workspace"
```
Since Neoload Web 2.5 (August 2020), assets are scoped to workspaces.
The CLI allows you to choose your workspace at login or with the "use" sub-command, otherwise the "Default Workspace" is used.\
**/!\\** The zones are shared between workspaces.


### Setup resources in Neoload Web
Run a test requires an infrastructure that is defined in Neoload Web Zones section [(see documentation how to manage zones)](https://www.neotys.com/documents/doc/nlweb/latest/en/html/#27521.htm#o39458)
You must at least have either a dynamic or a static zone with one controller and one load generator. At First, you could add resources to the "Default zone" since the CLI use it by default.

### Define a test settings
Test settings are how to run a test, a sort of template. Tests are stored in Neoload Web.
```
Usage: neoload test-settings [OPTIONS] [[ls|create|put|patch|delete|use]] [NAME]
neoload test-settings --zone defaultzone --lgs 5 --scenario sanityScenario create NewTest1
```
You must define :
 - Which scenario of the Neoload project to use

You can optionally define :
 - The test-settings description
 - The controller and load generator's zone to use (defaultzone is set by default)
 - How many load generators to use for the zone (1 LG on the defaultzone is set by default)
 - Advanced users who already have several zones with available resources in it, specify all zones and the number of LGs with --controller-zone-id and lg-zone-ids

To work with a specific test already created and be able to chain commands
```
neoload test-settings use NewTest1
neoload test-settings use 4a5e7707-75c0-4106-bbd4-68962ac7f2b3
```

### Upload a Neoload project
See basic projects examples on github [tests/neoload_projects folder](https://github.com/Neotys-Labs/neoload-cli/tree/master/tests/neoload_projects)
To upload a NeoLoad project zip file or a standalone as code file into a test-settings
```
Usage: neoload project [OPTIONS] [up|upload|meta] NAME_OR_ID
neoload project --path tests/neoload_projects/example_1/ upload
```
You must specify in which test the project will be uploaded:
* either by doing this command first
   <pre><code>neoload test-settings use NewTest1</code></pre>
* or by adding the name or id of the test to the project command
   <pre><code>neoload project --path tests/neoload_projects/example_1/ upload NewTest1</code></pre>

To Validate the syntax and schema of the as-code project yaml files
```
neoload validate sample_projects/example_1/default.yaml
```

### Excluding files from the project upload
If you are uploading a project directory that contains non NeoLoad as-code YAML files (such as .gitlab-ci.yml) you will need to create a .nlignore file (exactly the same as .gitignore) that excludes these files from the project upload process so that NeoLoad Web does not parse them and fail them as if they should be the NeoLoad DSL.

Please see Gitlab and Azure pipeline examples for more detail.

## Run a test
This command runs a test, it produces blocking, unbuffered output about test execution process, including readout of current data points.
At the end, displays the summary and the SLA passed & failed.
```
Usage: neoload run [OPTIONS] [NAME_OR_ID]
neoload run \         # Runs the currently used test-settings (see neoload status and neoload test-settings use)
     --as-code default.yaml,slas/uat.yaml \
     --name "MyCustomTestName_${JOB_ID}" \
     --description "A custom test description containing hashtags like #latest or #issueNum"
```
 - detach option kick off a test and returns immediately. Logs are displayed in Neoload Web (follow the url).
 - as-code option specify as-code yaml files to use for the test. They should already be uploaded with the project.
 - Test result name and description can be customized to include CI specific details (e.g. CI job, build number...).
 - Reservations can be used with either the reservationID or a reservation duration and a number of Virtual users.

If you are running in interactive console mode, the NeoLoad CLI will automatically open the system default browser to your live test results. \
When hitting Ctrl+C, the CLI will try to stop the test gracefully

### Stop a running test
```
neoload stop             # Send the stop signal to the test and wait until it ends.
```

## View results
```
Usage: neoload test-results [OPTIONS] [[ls|summary|junitsla|put|delete|use]] [NAME]
neoload test-results ls                 # Lists test results                                            .
neoload test-results use                # Remember the test result you want to work on.                           .
neoload test-results summary            # The Json result summary, with SLAs
neoload test-results junitsla           # Output the summary in a JUnit xml file
```
Metadata on a test can be modified after the test is complete, such as name, description, and status.\

To filter test results based on project, scenario, or status:
```
neoload test-results --filter "project=MyProject;scenario=fullTest" ls
neoload test-results --filter "status=TERMINATED|qualityStatus=FAILED" ls
```
NOTE: you can use either a semicolon OR a pipe, but not both interchangeably in the same filter.

To work with a specific test result and be able to chain commands
```
neoload test-results use 4a5e7707-75c0-4106-bbd4-68962ac7f2b3
```

Detailed logs and results are available on Neoload Web. To get the url of the current result :
```
neoload logs-url                        # The URL to the test in Neoload Web
```

## View zones
```
neoload zones --human
```
Display in a human readable way the list of all static and dynamic zones registered on Neoload Web, and the resources attached (controllers and load generators).

## Create local docker infrastructure to run a test [EXPERIMENTAL]

***WARNING: Docker features are not officially supported by Neotys as they rely heavily on your own Docker setup and environment. This command is only for local/dev test scenarios to simplify infrastructure requirements.***

NOTE: this functionality is not in the 1.0.0 version (May 2020 on Pypi), but is scheduled for inclusion by June 16th 2020.
 If you want to obtain this version before that time, please intall the version 1.1.0 release candidate from pypi:
```
pip install neoload==1.1.0rc1
```

If you want to use the latest commit of this feature, please pull this Git repo, checkout the topic-docker-command
 branch and install locally. You may need to uninstall your existing version of this CLI first:
```
python3 -m pip uninstall neoload
git clone https://github.com/Neotys-Labs/neoload-cli.git
cd neoload-cli
git checkout topic-docker-command
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

In certain environments, such as on a local dev workstation or in a Docker-in-Docker CI build node, it is useful
 to "bring your own infrastructure". In other words, when you don't already have a controller and load generators
 available in a zone, you can spin some up using Docker before the test starts. An example of an all-on-one approach:

```
neoload login $NLW_TOKEN \
        test-settings --zone $NLW_ZONE_STATIC --lgs 2 --scenario sanityScenario create NewTest1 \
        project --path tests/neoload_projects/example_1 upload \
        docker prepare
        run
```

What the 'docker prepare' CLI command does is to look at the test-settings for what zones and how many resources
 we need, then create local Docker containers and attach them to NeoLoad Web accordingly in preparation for 'run'.

```
Usage: neoload test-results [OPTIONS] [[prepare|attach|detach|forget]]

neoload docker prepare       # uses test-settings for 'run' command
neoload docker attach        # spin up Docker network and containers to be used for the test run
neoload docker detach        # remove Docker resources created to facilitate the test run
neoload docker forget        # disassociate 'run' command with docker; otherwise spin up/down Docker containers when run

Options:

--tag                        # the Docker tag (i.e. version) to use for ctrlimage and lgimage
--ctrlImage                  # the Docker image to use for the controller
--ctrlImage                  # the Docker image to use for the load generator(s)
--all                        # used in conjunction with 'detach' command; remove containers with label 'neoload-cli'
--add-hosts                  # add hosts overrides to containers; format is hostA=IP;hostB=IP
CLI
```

NOTE: Docker CLI must be installed on the system using these commands. This will use
 the Docker daemon, however it is configured. In a Docker-in-Docker context, this is inferred.
 For local workstations, it is sufficient to install Docker Desktop or Docker for Mac.

NOTE: If the 'prepare' or 'attach' actions are used before the 'run' command, the test will use or reuse
 the Docker configuration for infrastructure. This requires that all zones in test-settings be static zones.

NOTE: The 'forget' action undos the above note, in cases where static zones were in use by test-settings
 at first, but then were changed to use dynamic zones where Docker attaches make no sense.

NOTE: When using the 'detach' or 'forget' actions and containers are running, they will be stopped.
 There will be a prompt/check if stdin is attached to this process (typically not the case in CI)

### Pre-connecting Docker in Preparation for Consecutive Test Runs

You may also want to spin up Docker containers and keep them around for multiple test runs using the same
 infrastructure, such that:

```
neoload login $NLW_TOKEN

# configures for max number of LGs, starts with a sanity scenario (usually a 1-2min test)
neoload test-settings --zone $NLW_ZONE_STATIC --lgs 5 --scenario sanityScenario use NewTest1 \
        project --path tests/neoload_projects/example_1 upload

# spins up 5 LGs
neoload docker attach

# runs the configured sanityScenario, verifies infrastructure, routing, and project is ready for fullTest
neoload run

# reconfigure for fullTest and run, uses all 5 load generators
neoload test-settings --scenario fullTest use NewTest1 \
        run

# put this in an 'always' or 'finally' closure (in pipelines) to ensure Docker containers are spun down
neoload docker --all detach

```


## Continuous Testing Examples
The main goal of the NeoLoad-CLI is to standardize the semantics of how load tests are executed across development, non-prod, and production environments.
While the above instructions could be run from a contributor workstation, they can easily be translated to various continuous build and deployment orchestration environments, as exampled:

 - [Jenkins](https://github.com/Neotys-Labs/neoload-cli/tree/master/examples/pipelines/jenkins)
 - [Azure DevOps](https://github.com/Neotys-Labs/neoload-cli/tree/master/examples/pipelines/azure_devops)
 - [Gitlab](https://github.com/Neotys-Labs/neoload-cli/tree/master/examples/pipelines/gitlab)
 - [Bamboo](https://github.com/Neotys-Labs/neoload-cli/tree/master/examples/pipelines/bamboo-specs)
 - [AWS](https://github.com/Neotys-Labs/neoload-cli/tree/master/examples/pipelines/aws)
 - CircleCI, TBD when [@punkdata](https://www.linkedin.com/in/punkdata/) gets back to [@paulsbruce](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulsbruce/) :)

NB: When chaining commands, the return code of the whole command is the return code of the **last command**. That's why you should not chain the two commands "run" and "test-results junitsla".

NOTE: When combining NeoLoad projects and YAML-based pipeline declarations, please see [Excluding files from the project upload] (#excluding-files-from-the-project-upload) to ensure that unecessary artifacts aren't included in the project upload process.

### Support for fast-fail based on SLAs ###

Not all tests succeed. Sometimes environments are down. Sometimes 3rd parties are surprisingly slow. You don't
want to wait for your build pipelines to conduct the whole test duration if it's possible to identify these
issues early. Applying proper SLAs to your tests allows you to monitor for errors and latency during the test.

Consider the following SLA:

```
sla_profiles:
- name: geo_3rdparty_sla
  description: Avg Resp Time >=100ms >= 250ms for cached queries
  thresholds:
  - avg-resp-time warn >= 100ms fail >= 250ms per interval
  - error-rate warn >= 5% fail >= 10% per test
```

If you want to fail the pipeline if either of these thresholds are exceeded over a certain percent of their times,
you must:

- run the test in 'detached' mode to allow for non-blocking execution of a test
- use the fastfail command to monitor for early signals to stop the test if SLAs are violated
- finally wait for the test results

To run the test in detached mode:

```
neoload run \
    --detached
```

Then immediately afterwards, use the fastfail command:
```
neoload fastfail --max-failure 25 slas cur
```

In the above example, '25' represents the percent of times where the SLA was violated, such as 'on a particular
request with an SLA applied, 10 out of 50 times it was executed, the SLA failed'.

Finally, because the test was executed in non-blocking mode, you should wait for the final test result.
```
neoload wait cur
```

[An example for Jenkins pipeline is found here.](examples/pipelines/jenkins/Jenkinsfile_slafails)

## Packaging the CLI with Build Agents
Many of the above CI examples include a step to explicitly install the NeoLoad CLI as part of the
build steps. However, if you want the CLI baked into some build agent directly so that it
is ready for use during a job, here's a Docker example:

For Docker builds [See the test harness Alpine-based Dockerfile](https://github.com/Neotys-Labs/neoload-cli/blob/master/examples/docker/Dockerfile)


## IDE Integrations
Since most of what we do in an IDE is create/edit code, we're mostly interested in how to:
 - make it easy to write API tests in YAML (automatic syntax validation)
 - validate that tests do not contain unanticipated errors even at small scale
 - dry-run small (smoke) load tests locally so that code check-ins will work in CI/pipeline tests

Since the latter two cases are already covered by command-line semantics, our primary focus
is to accelerate test authoring by providing NeoLoad as-code DSL (Domain-specific Language) validation
and in some cases editor auto-complete.

Status of IDE / editor integrations

 | IDE / Editor       | Syntax checks | Auto-complete | Setup steps
 |:------------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:----------------:|
 | Visual Studio Code |      [x]      |      [x]      | [see instructions](resources/ides/vscode_settings.json) |
 | PyCharm |      [x]      |      [x]      | Mark 'neoload' directory as "Sources Root" |

## Contributing
Feel free to fork this repo, make changes, *test locally*, and create a pull request. As part of your testing, you should run the built-in test suite with the following command:

NOTE: for testing from Mac, please change the PYTHONPATH separators below to colons (:) instead of semicolons (;).

```
PYTHONPATH="neoload;tests/helpers" pytest -v
PYTHONPATH="neoload;tests/helpers" pytest -v -m "not slow"          # Skip slow tests that run tests

# Run on a real Neoload. Mocks are disabled
PYTHONPATH="neoload;tests/helpers" pytest -v --token <your_personal_token> --url https://neoload-api.saas.neotys.com/
```

Additionally, any contributions to the DSL validation functionality, such as on the JSON schema or the validate command, should execute the following tests locally before pushing to this repo:
```
./tests/neoload_projects/yaml_variants/validate_all.sh
```
This command executes a number of NEGATIVE tests to prove that changes to the JSON schema or validation process produce failures when their input is malformed in very specific ways (common mistakes).
